Fix: move monthly-threshold patch into handleVote() scope to avoid undefined variables (playerName/target).
Version bump to 1.9.2.

1.9.3: Removed duplicate dayKey/dailyKey declarations in incrementStats().

1.9.4: Merge duplicated 'monthly-reward:' blocks into one to avoid YAML conflicts.

1.9.5: Fix daily counter timezone mismatch — incrementStats now uses config timezone (monthly-reward.timezone) to match badge display.

1.9.6: Disable legacy MonthlyRewardManager payout by default with 'monthly-reward.legacy-manager.enabled: false' to prevent double payouts. Added guard in scheduler and checkMonthly().

1.9.8: Fix daily count not reflecting after vote — disabled legacy MonthlyRewardManager recordVote() calls by default to prevent votes.yml overwrite. Set 'monthly-reward.legacy-manager.enabled: true' to re-enable.

[Patch] 2025-10-28 (KST)
- Fixed: "[ 오늘 누적 추천수 n ]" did not increase on actual votes for non-voting players.
- Change: Announce badge now shows server-wide aggregated daily votes (dailyTotal.{yyyyMMdd}).
- Change: Every received vote now increments both per-player daily count and server-wide daily total.
- Safe: No command/config keys changed; existing data in votes.yml remains compatible.
