Fix: move monthly-threshold patch into handleVote() scope to avoid undefined variables (playerName/target).
Version bump to 1.9.2.

1.9.3: Removed duplicate dayKey/dailyKey declarations in incrementStats().

1.9.4: Merge duplicated 'monthly-reward:' blocks into one to avoid YAML conflicts.

1.9.5: Fix daily counter timezone mismatch — incrementStats now uses config timezone (monthly-reward.timezone) to match badge display.

1.9.6: Disable legacy MonthlyRewardManager payout by default with 'monthly-reward.legacy-manager.enabled: false' to prevent double payouts. Added guard in scheduler and checkMonthly().

1.9.8: Fix daily count not reflecting after vote — disabled legacy MonthlyRewardManager recordVote() calls by default to prevent votes.yml overwrite. Set 'monthly-reward.legacy-manager.enabled: true' to re-enable.

1.9.9 (2025-10-27 04:16): AutoNotice supports inline today-count placeholders.
- In `announce.message`, you can use `{{today}}` or `{{today_count}}`.
- Korean literal `오늘 누적 추천수 n` will be replaced with the actual number.
- If no placeholder is found, plugin appends the badge as before.
